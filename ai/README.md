# AI Resources for Drupal Best Practices

This folder contains AI-friendly assets derived from `README.md` (Sections 2 and 3) to help coding assistants apply Drupal 10+ best practices.

- `AGENTS.md`: contributor guidance for AI-generated content.
- `skills/claude-code-skills.md`: per-subsection skills aligned to site building and theming.
- `rules/best-practice-rules.md`: tool-agnostic rules for any CLI or IDE integration.
- `commands/commands.md`: slash-command triggers that map directly to best-practice sections.
- `scripts/validate-site-building.sh`: drush-based checks for section 2 topics (nodes, blocks, taxonomy, etc.).
- `scripts/validate-theming.sh`: drush-based checks for section 3 theming guidelines.

Ensure the project uses Drupal 10+ conventions; Drupal 7.x-only rules are intentionally omitted.
