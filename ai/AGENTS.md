# AI Authoring Instructions

- Scope: Applies to all files under `ai/`.
- Derive guidance from the repository README, prioritizing Drupal 10+ usage; do not reintroduce Drupal 7.x-only rules.
- Prefer concise, actionable checklists suited for AI-assisted development tools.
- Keep command examples tool-agnostic when possible; if a Drupal CLI is needed, favor `drush`, `ddev`, or `composer`.
- When adding scripts, include a short usage section and fail with clear, human-readable messages.
- Use lowercase, hyphenated file and command names for new helper artifacts.
