# AI Contribution Guide

- Follow the Drupal 10+ best practices documented in `README.md`, especially sections 2 (Site building) and 3 (Theming, templates).
- Keep generated guidance tool-agnostic whenever possible; mention specific CLIs (drush, ddev, composer, git) only when necessary.
- Prefer concise, actionable bullet points over long prose for skills, rules, and commands.
- When writing validation scripts, fail fast if required tools (e.g., `drush`) are missing and provide clear messaging.
- Do not introduce Drupal 7.x-only guidance.
